/* Data Types in JAVA:

1) Primiive
a) Integer (byte, short, int, long )
b) Float (double, float)
c) Character (It works on UNICODE) written as : char c = 'k' (in single quote and only one character)
d) Boolean (boolean b = true)

// Since java is a OOPs language so we make "classes" in it


class Hello
{
    public static void main(String a[])
    {
        int num1 = 9;
        byte by = 127; // can range values between -128 to 127
        short sh= 558;
        long l = 5854l; // must put l with number

        float marks = 6.5f; // default value of java is double so we have to specify "f" with numbers
        double d =5.8;

        char c= 'k'; //(in single quote and only one character) and 
        char ch = '8'; //character can be a number as well

        boolean b= true;
